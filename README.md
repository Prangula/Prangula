**'Junior Android Developer'**

I'm very motivated to become a skilled and
professional Android developer. I believe I already
possess some skills that make me eligible to work
as an intern. However,I recognize the importance
of gaining more practical, real-time experience,
which will provide me with opportunities to grow
and learn essential skills.
